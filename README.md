# conceptual-machine
just early hacking so far

"we derive CAVs by training a linear classifier between a conceptâ€™s examples and random counter examples and then taking the vector orthogonal to the decision boundary"

"a CAV encodes the direction of a concept in the vectorspace of a bottleneck"

"compute cosine similarity between a set of picturesof interest to the CAV to sort the pictures"
